# Data anonymization model (originally based on k-anonymity) with t-Closeness Constraint

This is the extended version of https://github.com/desstaw/DataPrivacy_SimulatedAnnealing/tree/main 
with t-closeness constraint for enhanced privacy preservation.

## About

This project extends the original model by implementing t-closeness constraints 
as part of my Bachelor thesis at Goethe University Frankfurt, 2025.

Additionally, the anonymization of the datasets Adult and MIMIC-III can be shown as Streamlit 
demo app. For the extended model, the app was also adjusted.

All the contributions made by me (Gabriela Senkevic) are marked with '#GS:'

To run the app, execute the 'DemoApp_SA_MIMICIII_Adult.ipynb' Jupyter Notebook. The app will automatically open in 
your browser. If error messages occur in the web browser, you can alternatively run 'streamlit run app.py' in the 
terminal, after navigating to the current working directory after running the Jupyter Notebook.
